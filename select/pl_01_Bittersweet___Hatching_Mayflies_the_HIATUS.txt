Hope to me was a big red balloon
Deflating slowly and still stuck to the ceiling
Hope to me is like a figure in the hazy doze
I know it's fine
And all these good lies
As if woken from my sleep
I know it's fine
And all these good byes
As if stolen from my dreams
Hope to me was an old plush bear
Tossed aside one intense sunny day
Hope to me is like a petrol rainbow in a puddle
I know it's fine
And all these good lies
As if woken from my sleep
I know it's fine
And all these good byes
As if stolen from my dreams
I know it's fine
Some of these mayflies
As they hatch in brackish streams
I know it's fine
And all this moonrise
As it falls on haunting lanes
You found me
You healed me
You touched me
I saw you
You wrapped me
You dragged me
You caught me
I saw you
You found me
You found me
You found me
You found me
