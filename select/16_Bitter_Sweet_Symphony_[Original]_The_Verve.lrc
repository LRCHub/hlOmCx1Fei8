[00:35.95] 'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony, that's life
[00:59.95] 
[00:46.85] Tryin' to make ends meet, you're a slave to money then you die
[01:17.85] 
[00:58.07] I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
[01:09.22] You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah
[01:47.22] 
[01:21.21] No change, I can change, I can change, I can change
[01:26.01] But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold
[01:31.64] But I'm a million different people from one day to the next
[01:37.56] I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no
[01:43.12] (Have you ever been down?)
[01:56.12] 
[01:54.82] Well, I've never prayed, but tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
[02:05.43] I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
[02:36.43] 
[02:16.61] I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
[02:48.11] 
[02:27.87] But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now
[02:59.37] 
[02:40.12] No change, I can change, I can change, I can change
[02:45.73] But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold
[02:50.53] And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
[02:56.18] I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no
[03:01.95] (Have you ever been down?)
[03:03.59] I can't change it you know
[03:05.94] I can't change it
[03:14.44] 
[03:08.69] 'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony, that's life
[03:32.69] 
[03:24.17] Tryin' to make ends meet, tryin' to find some money then you die
[03:56.17] 
[03:35.58] I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
[04:01.58] 
[03:37.18] You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah
[04:15.18] 
[03:45.60] You know, I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
[03:46.43] But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold
[03:47.87] And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
[03:52.86] I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no
[04:08.36] I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no
[04:09.61] I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no
[04:30.61] 
[04:10.44] It's just sex and violence, melody and silence
[04:12.82] It's just I can't change my violence, melody and violence
[04:15.57] I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down (sex and violence, melody and silence)
[04:18.21] It's just I can't change my violence, melody and silence
[04:18.46] I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down (sex and violence, melody and silence)
[05:03.96] 
[04:28.59] Been down
[04:29.64] Ever been down
[04:30.79] Ever been down
[04:32.56] Ever been down
[04:34.16] Have you ever been down?
[04:34.91] Have you ever been down?
[04:35.58] Have you ever been down?
