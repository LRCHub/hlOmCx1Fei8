This - bitter earth
Well, What a fruit it bears

Oooh
This - bitter earth

And if my life
Is like the dust

Oooh
That hides the glow of a rose

What good am I
Heaven only knows

No, this bitter Earth
Yes, can be so cold

Today you're young
Too soon you're old

But while a voice
Within me cries

I'm sure someone
May answer my call

And if my life
Is like the dust

What good am I
Heaven only knows

No, this bitter Earth
Yes, can be so cold

Today you're young
Too soon you're old

But while a voice
Within me cries

I'm sure someone
May answer my call

And this bitter earth ooooooh
May not be ohhhh, so bitter after all

This - bitter earth

No, this bitter Earth
What good is love

Mmmmmmmm
That no one shares
And if my life

Is like the dust
Oooh

That hides the glow of a rose
What good am I
What good am I
Heaven only knows
